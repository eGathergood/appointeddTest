### Apppintedd Code Test

This solution for the appointedd code test has been implemented using React/Typescript and some utilites from the date-fns {https://date-fns.org/} library.

# Question 1

Question 1 returns the expected output seen in the specification.

# Question 2

Question 1 returns the expected output seen in the specification.

# Question 3

Some complications were encountered during Question 3, the output contains three extra intervals when compared to the expected output.
This is due to the solution only outputting intervals which have 2 employees free rather than "two or more", however for a realistic use case I feel that having full intervals where multiple workers are free could be more useful than only showing a 15 minute interval with 3 workers free. NOTE: The expected outputs are contained in the solution
